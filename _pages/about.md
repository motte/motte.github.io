    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
    I have worked in big health care, big data genomics, consumer products, and enterprise solutions.
    <br /><br />
    In addition to being a software engineer and product manager at startups, I had the privilege of being the assistant to the former U.S. Surgeon General (Dr. C. Everett Koop), an EMT ("an ambulance driver"), a clinical healthcare professional, and an immunology translational/clinical researcher.
    <br /><br />
    I am a "full-solution" engineer, with experience building complete systems with native mobile (primarily Swift these days) and full frontend/backend web.  I also enjoy hardware hacking.
    <br /><br />
    My joy has been frontend web since age 10, but recently, I have enjoyed iOS Swift.
