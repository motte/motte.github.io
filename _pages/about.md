    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I have worked in big health care, big data genomics, consumer products, and enterprise solutions.
    <br />
    In addition to being a software engineer and manager, I have been the assistant to the 13th US Surgeon General (Dr. C. Everett Koop), an EMT ("an ambulance driver"), a healthcare professional, and an immunology translational/clinical researcher.
    <br />
    I am a full-stack engineer from native mobile (primarily Swift these days) to frontend/backend web.  I am also a hardware hacker.
    <br />
    My joy has been frontend web for many years, but I have recently been enjoying iOS Swift.</p>
